#
# Check some expression operator precedences.
#

# Note -- Adrift's operator precedence seems to be somewhat wacky.  The
# expressions calculated here are:
#   a := -7+6+5^4-3*2
#   b := -7+(6*5)^(4-3)*2
#   c := (1--1)+(1+-1)+-1
#   d := 10+10/2-(10+10)/2
#   e := 10+15mod7-(10+15)mod7
# For normal precedence, the results should be:
#   a = "618" b = "53" c = "1" d = "5" e = "7"
# However, Adrift appears to lump exponentiation and modulus in with addition
# and subtraction, giving a completely different set of results.  As a result,
# SCARE's expression parser tries to replicate this, even though it's arguably
# rather broken.

a = "250" b = "529" c = "1" d = "5" e = "0"

# TODO Adrift somehow fiddles with the casing of object states so that in

# it's a bug; for now this test permits both below for state_switch.
#
# TODO In a couple of cases, SCARE prints "<objects> are in <container>"
# where Adrift uses "Inside <container> are <objects>".  Adrift has two
# possible formats it could use here, and the selection criteria it uses for
# this (if any) isn't yet known.  For now, these test expectations have been
# altered to allow the test to pass.
