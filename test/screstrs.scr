# Simple task restriction tests.
#
# Covers tasks restrictions.  Only a simple test of sequentially AND'ed
# restriction is performed here, and the test uses referenced text and number
# but no real variables.
#
# Note that this test is far from exhaustive, and really only scratches the
# surface.  The combinatorial explosion of possibilities makes complete testing
# problematic.
#
# Unless otherwise noted, the input and responses in this script were created
# from a transcript of the Adrift Runner, release 4.0.45 or 46.
