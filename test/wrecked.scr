# This script implements a section of the shadowvault walkthrough for Wrecked.
# Unfortunately, there is something about (I think) event timing that is
# special to version 3.80, and which isn't quite replicated in SCARE.  This
# renders this game unwinnable under SCARE.
#
# For now, then, this test progresses as far as the point where SCARE's
# output deviates from that of the Runner.  From then onwards, expectations
# are disabled, allowing the test to succeed even though incomplete.
#
# For the enabled parts of the test, the following edits were necessary:
#
#   o "take a..." changed to "take the..." to match what looks like a Runner
#     change between 3.80 and the 4.00 that SCARE emulates
#   o a similar change for
#     object inside another object messages
#   o "I can only move..." changed to # "There is an exit..." for the initial
#     room "look" response
#   o "locker" changed to "red locker" (disambiguation?)
#   o "Inside ... is a ..." changed to "A ... is inside ...".
#   o changes to make randomized messages agree with those produced by SCARE's
#     random number sequence.

Wrecked
A few months ago, I got talking to a mate, who got me interested in
shipwrecks. I never knew there was so much unclaimed treasure lying at
the bottom of the oceans. All you need to do is find a wreck, search it,
and you're a billionaire. At least, that was the way he put it.

Nevertheless, being the single minded individual I am, I decided to give
it a shot. I did a bit of research, found out about a particular ship
which was supposed to have sunk in not too deep waters, and got my
supplies together.

I finally arrive at a village, not too far from where the ship is
supposed to be, only to step off the bus and have all my stuff stolen
when I wasn't looking by a pizza-faced 14 year old, desperate to feed
some drug addiction. Bugger!

So anyway, I'm now stranded in this stupid village, which I think they
call "Ambersville", without any money, only the clothes I'm wearing, and
a rather desperate ambition!

This adventure is best run on Runner build 9.20.1 or later.

I am at the bus stop. The main road runs in a north-south direction.
There is a rather flimsy looking bus shelter here, with a plastic bench
which looks like it's seen better days. There is an exit west.

> x shelter
The bus shelter consists of a perspex wall with a roof over it. In the
shelter is a bright red plastic bench. The sides of the bus shelter have
lots of graffiti written all over it. There is a timetable on the side
of the shelter.

> x graffiti
Ridiculous isn't it. Who writes this stuff[?]

> read graffiti
JD fancies me! Up the Celts. SFD rules! Phone 4388 for a good time. My
other bus shelter's a Porsche.

> west
I move west.
*
I am next to a large dog kennel, bizarrly in the middle of nowhere.
Also here is a large shark hook. There is a very large dog here, tied up
by the kennel. I can move north, east, south, west and in.

> south
I move south.
*
I am outside a spanking new building. There is a large sign over the
door telling me that this is a swimming pool. I can move north, west and
in.

> in
I move in.
*
I am at the reception of the swimming pool. There is no-one in sight. An
entrance leads into the changing rooms. I can move in and out.

> in
I move in.
*
I am inside the swimming pool changing rooms. There are a number of
lockers running along the wall (I don't mean literally of course), and
there is a bench next to the lockers. I can move in and out.

> x bench
The bench is made from several planks of wood, and has been varnished a
deep brown colour. A tweed jacket is on the bench.

> get jacket
I take the tweed jacket from the bench.

> x jacket
The tweed jacket is a delightful brown colour. It looks a bit worn,
especially at the elbows. A small key is inside the tweed jacket.

> get key
I take the small key from the tweed jacket.

> x lockers
There are lockers running down the whole wall. All are a different
colour. All the lockers, bar a bright red one, appear to be locked.

> x red locker
The bright red locker appears to be the only one which isn't locked. The
locking mechanism in the locker requires a coin to lock it. The red locker
is open.

> close red locker
As I close the red locker, I hear a clunking noise, as though something
has fallen out of the locking mechanism. I open the door again.

> x red locker
The bright red locker appears to be the only one which isn't locked. The
locking mechanism in the locker requires a coin to lock it. The red locker
is open. Inside the red locker is a small silver coin.

> get coin
I take the small silver coin from the red locker.

> out
I move out.
*
I am at the reception of the swimming pool. There is no-one in sight. An
entrance leads into the changing rooms. I can move in and out.

I am outside a spanking new building. There is a large sign over the
door telling me that this is a swimming pool. I can move north, west and
in.

> west
I move west.
*
I am outside the village pub. It looks like this is the usual hang about
for the youth of Ambersville. Biff and Boff are here. I can move north,
east, west and in. A couple of seagulls fly about aimlessly.

> go in
I move in.
*
I am inside a quaint little pub. There is a bar over in one corner of
the pub. A number of tables are scattered around, and the floor looks as
though it could do with a clean. Arthur is standing behind the bar,
looking at me. I can only move out.

> buy pint
I hand the barman my shiny silver coin. "Ta very much." Arthurs eyes
gleam as he takes the coin. "Here you go." He places a pint of lager
onto the bar.

> get pint
I take the pint of lager from the bar.

> out
I move out.

"Oh cheers mate. What was it you wanted - a pen. Here ya go. It's nearly
run out anyway." Boff hands me a rather used looking marker pen.

> west
I move west.
*
I am outside a rather run down motel. To my south is a rather tall wire
fence. Through the fence, I can see a scrapyard with lots of old cars.
There is a closed gate here. I can move north, east, west and in.

> north
I move north.
*
I am outside the village post office. The roof of the post office is
fairly low. There is a bright red post box set outside the door of the
post office. I can move north, east, south and in.

> go in
I move in.
*
I am inside the post office. There is a counter on the far wall, which
has a glass screen in front of it, presumably protecting the workers
from vicious members of society such as myself. On another wall is a
leaflet rack. Madge watches me intently from behind the glass screen. I
can only move out.

> x rack
The leaflet rack is a delightful dark brown colour. There appear to be a
few sweety wrappers, and the odd bit of chewing gum stuffed inside it.
Inside the leaflet rack is an application form.

> get form
I take the application form from the leaflet rack.

> fill form out
I fill out the application form.

> out
I move out.

there's not a lot around here. There is a large sign here. It is raining.
I can only move east.


#
# From this point on, something about 3.80 event timing prevents SCARE from
# replicating the 3.80 Runner.  The core of the problem is the lack of any
# "Can I see your ticked" demand from Boris, a consequent failure to get
# thrown off the moving train, and no way to enter the junkyard.
#
# For now, then, the remainder of the test is neutralized by removing all
# expectations.  This at least allows us to exercise code in SCARE, even if
# we don't verify its output.

#cat's eyes bulge out slightly. "I'm so grateful, here, take this." Madge
#removes the amulet from around her neck, and gives it to me

#I move out.
#I am outside the village post office. The roof of the post office is

#listing on one side. I can move up and in.

> in
#I move in.
#I am inside the shipwreck. There are various bits of wood floating
#around, and most of the ship appears to be rotten. There appears to be
#an old wooden cabinet upside-down against one wall. I can only move out.

> x cabinet
#The cabinet is made from wood, but appears to be much stronger than I
#would have thought. There is a hexagonal shaped indentation on the
#closed door.

> put amulet in indentation
#I put the hexagonal amulet into the hexagonal indentation on the cabinet
#door. It fits perfectly. I twist the amulet, and the door springs open.

> read log book
#The last entry in the log reads; "Today we hid our treasure in the old
#sewer system in Ambersville, as I fear our journey today is extremely
#treacherous..." It goes on, but isn't very exciting.

#I knock on the door three times. An attractive lady answers the door.
#"Come on in."

#Suzie's computer is switched on. She appears to be creating an ADRIFT
#adventure.

> ask suzie about adrift
#"I'm making an ADRIFT adventure. I've tried using Inform, TADS and Hugo,
#but I'd say ADRIFT is by far the best."

> ask suzie about a good time
#"Oh, that. That'll be referring to my musical talents."

> give flute to suzie
#I hand the small flute to Suzie. Her eyes light up. "A flute! I've been
#wanting to play one for ages." She takes it off me, and begins to play a
#beautiful tune.
#"You can have it if you like.", I say. Suzie looks at me.
#"Are you sure[?]"
#"Yep, you seem to like it."
#"Oh, well, I'll have to give you something in return. Just a minute."
#Suzie disappears behind the couch, and brings back a pair of
#night-vision goggles. "Here, take these. I never use them."

#I am in the village sewer system. The sides of the sewer walls are made

#tiles has fallen off, presumably from the rush of water. Also here is a
#gold card. I can only move up.

> x tiles
#The wall tiles are quite large, but are surprisingly clean and smell of
#chlorine. One of the tiles is missing, revealing a small hole.

> x hole
#The hole has appeared where one of the wall tiles has fallen off. On
#closer inspection, I can see a keyhole situated in the middle of the hole.

> put key in keyhole
#I put the bronze key in the keyhole, and turn it. One whole side of the
#sewer opens up, revealing a secret passageway.

#I am at the end of the secret passage. In front of me is a large
#portcullis. To the right of the portcullis is a slot. Through the
#portcullis, I can just make out a large chest. I can only move north.

> x slot
#The slot looks as though something should be inserted into it. I think
#it's connected to the portcullis.

> put stick in slot
#I put the stick into the slot. It fits perfectly, creating a lever.

> pull lever
#I pull down hard on the chewed looking lever. Slowly, but surely, the
#portcullis raises.

> south
#I move south.
#I am in an underground cavern. In the middle of the room sits a huge
#wooden chest. I can only move north.

> x chest
#The chest is huge. The name The Unsinkable is stencilled on the lid. The
#chest is closed.

> open chest
#I carefully open the chest. Suddenly, a stream of poisonous gas ejects
#from inside the chest, filling the room. Luckily, I'm wearing the scuba
#outfit, and it appears to be working, because the gas has no effect on
#me. It takes a while for the gas to clear, but when it does, I see a
#chest full of gold.

#Well done. Now, all you have to do is figure how the hell you're going
#to get this chest out of the sewer! Then you'll probably end up losing
#most of it to pay off you credit card bill, but that's not my problem.

#Hope you enjoyed playing Wrecked.
