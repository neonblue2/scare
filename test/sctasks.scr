# Simple task action tests.
#
# Covers the basic task actions involving object and NPC movement, and ending
# the game.  Variable and score changes are not covered as they're already
# used elsewhere in other tests.
#
# Note that this test is far from exhaustive, and really only scratches the
# surface.  The combinatorial explosion of possibilities makes complete testing
# problematic.
#
# Unless otherwise noted, the input and responses in this script were created
# from a transcript of the Adrift Runner, release 4.0.45 or 46.

#
# Test task actions that relocate all objects worn and held by the player.
#

> open cupboard, take all from cupboard, wear hat
> inventory
You are wearing a floppy hat, and you are carrying a book, a tray, a bag, a
sandwich and a jelly.

> relocate
As if by magic, everything relocates.

> inventory
You are carrying nothing.

> x me
You are as well as can be expected, considering the circumstances.

> east
You move east.
Clean Room
As bland as the Activity Room, but somehow cleaner.  There's a sign on the
wall that proclaims "No food or drink, please."  Also here is a book, a tray,
a bag, a sandwich, a jelly and a floppy hat.  The janitor is here.  You can
only move west.


#
# Verify tasks that use the referenced object or NPC to hide something.
#

> x book
A copy, apparently, of the Adrift manual. Version 4.00 no less. It looks
like it might be almost new; the dust cover still wraps nicely around it.

~ objects 1
*In Room 1*

> hide book
Object hidden.

~ objects 1
*Hidden*

> x book
# Note -- Adrift seems to differentiate between invisible objects never seen
# and those seen but no longer visible.  SCARE doesn't, so there's a difference
# here in the message printed.
#You can't see the book from here!
You see no such thing.

> x janitor
Dressed head to toe in standard janitorial coveralls, this man appears to be
the very model of efficiency.  No sign at all of sloppiness or laziness here.

Also, not much sign of movement, it has to be said.

~ npcs 0
*In Room 1*

> hide janitor
Character hidden.

# Note -- See above for a description of the difference here between Adrift and
# SCARE.
#You cannot see the janitor from here.
You see no such thing.


#
# Verify that tasks can move the player.
#

> west
You move west.
Activity Room
Sparsely furnished, the walls are white and unadorned, and the carpet is a
bland shade of grey. Frankly, very little promise here for diversionary
activity.  Also here is a pinewood cupboard, a pinewood table and a chair.
You can only move east.

> move player
Player moved.

> look

# NPC moved, and tray moved to held by NPC.
> x janitor
Dressed head to toe in standard janitorial coveralls, this man appears to be
the very model of efficiency.  No sign at all of sloppiness or laziness here.

Also, not much sign of movement, it has to be said.  The janitor is carrying
a tray.

# Bag moved onto tray, and jelly moved inside the bag.
> x tray
Decorated with purple flowers of some kind. It could be worse, though.
Kittens nestling in lace-lined baskets, for example.  A bag is on the tray.  

> x bag
This looks like the carpetbag from "To Hell in a Hamper."  How on earth did
this get here?  The bag is closed.

# Note -- Adrift stops the player opening the bag until it's carried.  SCARE
# doesn't, so the following succeeds on SCARE if we let it past.
#> open bag
#You are not carrying the bag!

> take bag, open the bag
You take the bag from the tray.
You open the bag.  A jelly is inside the bag.

> take tray
The janitor refuses to give you the tray!

# Game ending tasks.  Because the script framework can't resurrect or restart
# an ended game, we can check only one of these automatically.
#

#> restart
#> win game
#Game won.
# Note -- Adrift adds "congratulations!" on the status line, we add it here.
#Congratulations!

I'm afraid you are dead!
