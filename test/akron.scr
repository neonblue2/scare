# This script implements the shadowvault walkthrough for Akron.  This is a
# short-ish game, and not particularly challenging in terms of the Adrift
# features it uses.  However, SCARE can't current run Wrecked to completion,
# and there are only a few 3.80 games in existence (there's no shadowvault
# walkthrough for Cave of Wonders), so having this script does allow us to
# confirm that SCARE can run at least one 3.80 game to completion.
#
# The following edits were necessary:
#   o "take a..." changed to "take the..." to match what looks like a Runner
#     change between 3.80 and the 4.00 that SCARE emulates

Akron - an adventure game v. 0.1

Your eyes flutter open. What happened[?] Jumbled memories bounce through
your mind. A swank nightclub... the Charleston... Elizabeth Dole... a
1957 Plymouth Valiant... What does it all mean[?]
Nothing is clear. You have no idea who you are, or what you have done. A
strange mantra begins to float in your brain. "Akron... Akron..."
Suddenly it hits you. This is your hometown! Akron! You live here!
But... where[?]
Standing up wearily, you look around. Nothing seems familiar... this is
just a dank alleyway. And yet, somehow you know that in the city of
Akron, somewhere, is your home, and your wife (if you have one).
Now your resolution is firm. You will tramp down every street in Akron,
the entire state of Ohio if necessary. You WILL discover who you are!

You are squelched up between two apartment buildings. Clearly this isn't
the best part of Akron - there is mud everywhere, and a fossilized
t-shirt is stuck to the ground. Northwards is Garbanzo Street, which
runs as far as you can see both east and west. A library card sits on
the ground.

In a dim alleyway
You are squelched up between two apartment buildings. Clearly this isn't
the best part of Akron - there is mud everywhere, and a fossilized
t-shirt is stuck to the ground. Northwards is Garbanzo Street, which
runs as far as you can see both east and west. Also here is a library card.

> get card
You pick up the library card.

You move north.
Central Garbanzo Street
This is Garbanzo Street, in the south end of Akron. It stretches as far
as the eye can see both east and west. There is surprisingly little
traffic - of course, at 11:15 AM, most people are comfortably settled
into their jobs. A station wagon is pulled over in a nearby parking
space. Across the street to the north is the Akron Public Library.

> n
You move north.
Inside Akron Public Library
Akron Public Library is a small community library, with a relatively
limited selection of books. You're in the front alcove, which contains
only the checkout/return desk and a cart which seems to contain the
books to be filed. What books they do have are in a room to the north.
Southwards is Garbanzo Street. The librarian stands behind the
checkout/return desk.

> show card to librarian
The librarian looks at your card, and nods. Immediately, someone else
comes in and drops two books onto the return cart.

> x return cart
This is a medium sized metal cart, containing books to be shelved.
You're more than welcome to take books from it. A thick book and a thin
book are on the return cart.

> get thick book
You take the thick book from the return cart.

> get thin book
You take the thin book from the return cart.

West Garbanzo Street
This is the western end of Garbanzo Street, extending into the
industrial district. There is a factory here that looks like it makes
cars. Its entrance is to the north. To the south is a boarded-up store.
West of you is a suburb complex, and east is Central Garbanzo Street.

> s
You move south.
Outside the boarded-up store
You stand just outside what was formerly some kind of men's clothing
store. All the windows are boarded up, and the canopy above the door is
torn. The door itself is southwards, and Garbanzo street is to the north.

> stand on thick book
You drop Great Expectations onto the floor, and stand up on top. Now you
can see what's on the canopy - it's a small brass key. It clatters to
the floor.

> get key
You pick up the small brass key.

> unlock door
You put the key into the door, and it fits easily. The door is now
unlocked, and you open it.

> s
You move south.
The boarded-up store
This is a deserted men's clothing store. Empty racks are all around you
- there seems to be no merchandise. Even the cash register is empty.
This is not a very cheerful place. Also here is a spiffy tuxedo.

> get tuxedo
You pick up the spiffy tuxedo.

> i
You are wearing a grubby sweatshirt and a pair of ragged jeans, and you
are carrying a library card, a thick book, a thin book, a small brass
key and a spiffy tuxedo.

> remove sweatshirt
You remove the grubby sweatshirt.

> remove jeans
You remove the pair of ragged jeans.

> wear tuxedo
You put the tuxedo on. Boy, do you look good.

East Garbanzo Street
Garbanzo Street makes a sharp curve to the left here, just managing to
stay inside Akron city limits. Beyond it, to the east, is a large
cornfield. To the north is a convenience store, and to the south is a
vacant lot. Central Garbanzo Street is back west.

The vacant lot
There is next to nothing here. Some trash has been tossed into this
area, but most of it is rotten. Looks like someone plans to build here
eventually, though. Also here is the surveyor's stake.

Lost in the cornfield
You have blundered into a cornfield. Oh my. It looks like this is
another one of those annoying mazes that the programmer loves so much.
Well, let me give you a little hint - just go NORTH and you'll be out of
the maze! You see, I, the computer, have changed this game JUST FOR YOU!
Or, I can - oh no. The programmer's coming. AIEEEEEEEEEEEEE...

> go north
You move north.
A clearing in the cornfield
Wow! You made it all the way through the maze! I'm so impressed! This is
a clearing in the cornfield. WOAH! Prancing around you is... is... it's
a demon form of Elizabeth Dole! SHE WANTS YOUR SOUL! Better defeat her,
quick! The demon Elizabeth Dole is here, prancing around you.

> drive stake through elizabeth's heart
You drive the surveyor's stake right through Elizabeth Dole's heart. She
screams, and melts away - much like the Wicked Witch of the West. As she
melts, she drops a small passcard onto the ground.

> get passcard
You pick up the small passcard.

The Johnson automotive plant's lobby
This is the lobby of the Johnson automotive plant, employer of nearly
everybody in this part of Akron. (It is, in fact, one of the only
factories in Akron that doesn't deal with rubber.) Cars, mostly
Plymouths, litter this area. A large desk is at the front, with a clerk
behind it. The smiling desk clerk sits here, reading a Danielle Steele
novel.

> show passcard to clerk
The clerk looks at your passcard warily. "I'm not sure I should... oh
well, go on in." She motions toward a westward door, which you had not
previously noticed.

The Johnson automotive plant
Machines clang all around you. Workers bustle in every direction. Noise
is shattering your ears. Better spend as little time here as you can.
The exit into the lobby is back to the east. Also here is a wedding ring.

Kumquat Avenue
Garbanzo Street becomes Kumquat Avenue here, as we enter the Smallwood
Green subdivision housing complex. It stretches further on to the west,
and Garbanzo Street is to the east.

West Kumquat Avenue
Kumquat Avenue reaches a dead end here. Interestingly, there is a police
car parked outside the house at the dead end to the west (37 Kumquat).
Maybe you should check it out.

> w
You move west.
The doorstep of 37 Kumquat Avenue
You stand on the doorstep outside 37 Kumquat Avenue. Officer Stanley
Peters, of the Ohio Police Department, stands in front of the door. "Get
out of here," he orders you. "There is serious police business going on
inside." You're a little skeptical of that, as there's only one police
car parked outside.. Officer Stanley Peters stands guard in front of the
door.

> give thin book to officer
Officer Peters looks at the Treatise on Crippled Shareware. "Wow!" he
exclaims. "I've been wanting to read this for weeks! Where on earth did
you find it[?]" Clutching the book, he races down the stairs into his car
and slams the door.

> knock
You rap on the door of 37 Kumquat Avenue. After a minute or two, the
door opens. "FRED!" It's your wife, Martha. "Oh, Fred, it really is
you!" As Martha ushers you into her living room, smippets of memory
start to come back. You recognize this place... YES!
Last night, you, Fred Johnson, owner of the Johnson Automotive Plant,
had gone to Cleveland in your '57 Valiant to a dinner given by the Auto
Workers Union for Elizabeth Dole. The theme had been the 1920s, and
everyone was forced to do the Charleston.
However, on the way home, you were intercepted by a witch doctor who did
NOT like Elizabeth Dole. When she realized you were a supporter, she
cast a spell on you that removed all of your memories. Then, she put
those ragged clothes on you, and left you for dead in the alley off
Garbanzo Street. But you, you brave adventurer, saved yourself! And now,
you will live happily ever after!
(Since this is an untested release of the game, I would REALLY
appreciate some feedback. Email me at markusrtk@golden.net, or I'll send
Hillary Clinton after you!)
