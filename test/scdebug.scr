# SCARE debugger tests.
#
# Covers basic debugger input parsing, inspecting game details, and setting
# (though not trapping) game watchpoints.
#
# There are some limitations to what can be done here.  For example, the
# debugger is removed from the game by scripting on standard (non-debug)
# commands, so watchpoints can't be checked.  Also, the test game contains no
# variables or events, so these cannot be tested thoroughly (though this does
# let us check the debugger response where there are no items of a particular
# class).  We can't check invalid debugger commands (the script rejects them),
# nor can we catch the game with buffered output text.

# Verify a few basic commands.
#

~ help
The following debugging commands examine game state: *

~ help help
Give the name of the command you want help on, for example 'help continue'.

~ buffer
There is no game text buffered.

~ resources
There is no game resource activity.

~ random
The congruential random number generator is selected.
~ random 0
The seed value may not be zero.
~ random 1
Set seed 1 for the congruential random number generator.
~ random 2147483647
Set seed 2147483647 for the congruential random number generator.

# Not testable, as these are rejected by the script.

# Check the output formats, at least for available items.
